# elm-startapp
This repo has main.elm files for various programs, ready to go.

Often when starting an elm project it takes some time for beginners (including me) just to get main.elm to compile. These file are intended to get you started with your actual project right away.

If you just want to copy the content of the main-*.elm file, make sure to run `elm-package install elm-lang/html` first.
